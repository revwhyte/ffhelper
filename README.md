## Fighting Fantasy Helper

[The Fighting Fantasy books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy) really made my teenage years better.

It was fun to live an adventure using just a book, a pencil, some dice and my imagination.
Using only those tools, I could live as many stories as I wanted, and I really missed it after I grew up, because the books were really rare at my city (the ones I used to play were borrowed, and I didn't have access to many of them).

Long story short: A brazilian publisher brought those books back and I, of course, bought many of them, so I could feel that feeling again.
And I decided to add a new tool to that new journey: a helper.

### What is FF Helper?

FF Helper will help you with your stats, your loot and let you play without worrying about it.
All you have to do is start a journey and save it when you're done, so you can continue another time exactly where you stopped.
Just give that story a name and that's it: you can bring it back again later.
